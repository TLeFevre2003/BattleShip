# Overview
With this battle ship program, my goal was to learn C++ and get a solid foundation that I could build on. The plan was to create a battleship game to get accustomed to the syntax and properties of C++.

I wrote a clone of the game Battle Ship that runs in the console. The game is fully functional and is two player allowing the user to play with a friend.


The purpose for writing this software was to learn C++, I picked battle ship because it would have a variety of necessary functions and I could get a more complete grasp of the language.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to create this software was Xcode on Mac. Xcode is great because it configures everything by itself, and it allows you to focus primarily on coding the game. I also used GIT for version control.

The programming language I used was C++. I used a few libraries as well. iostream for standard input and output, thread to allow waiting after each players turn, and array to use the array class. The array class is nice because it is a full data structure, while the default array in C++ is very limited.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Use classes, create a board class that can handle the board and board related functions.
- Single player mode, I would like a single player mode with an AI opponent.
- GUI, eventually I would like to add a GUI for a more polished and user friendly look.
